## Introduction to Next.js

### What is Next.js?

Next.js is a popular React framework that enables you to build server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. It provides a powerful set of features out of the box, making it easier for developers to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.

### Key features and benefits

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Automatic code splitting
- Built-in CSS support
- API routes
- Image optimization
- Fast refresh for development
- TypeScript support

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Installing Node.js and npm

Before getting started with Next.js, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

 To verify your installation, open a terminal and run: 

```bash
node --version
npm --version */}

# Different Ways to Deploy Your Web Apps

Deploying a web app involves making your application available for users on the internet. There are several methods to deploy web apps, each with its pros and cons. In this post, we'll explore some of the most popular deployment options. Highly inspired by **Harkirat's** youtube video on [how to deploy web apps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gViEtIJ1DCw&t=3036s&ab_channel=HarkiratSingh)

## 1. Static Site Hosting

Static site hosting is ideal for static websites that don't require a server to generate content dynamically. These sites are typically built using frameworks like Next.js in static export mode. Static sites are fast, secure, and easy to deploy, making them a popular choice for blogs, portfolios, and simple web applications.

### Vercel

Vercel is designed to work seamlessly with modern front-end frameworks, especially Next.js. It provides an exceptional developer experience with features like:

- **Automatic Builds**: Vercel automatically rebuilds and deploys your site every time you push changes to your repository, ensuring your site is always up to date.
- **Integrated CDN**: Your content is cached on a global CDN, providing fast load times for users worldwide.
- **Serverless Functions**: Easily add backend functionality with Vercel's serverless functions, which scale automatically based on demand.
- **Custom Domains**: Quickly set up custom domains with automatic HTTPS.
- **Analytics**: Gain insights into your site’s performance with built-in analytics.
- **Documentation**: Link to the official [vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview)

To deploy a Next.js app to Vercel, you can simply import your GitHub repository and follow the setup prompts. Vercel takes care of the rest, from building to deploying your app.

### Netlify

Netlify is another powerful platform for deploying static sites. It offers a range of features that streamline the deployment process:

- **Continuous Deployment**: Connect your Git repository to Netlify, and it will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes.
- **Form Handling**: Netlify makes it easy to manage forms without needing a backend server. Simply add a form to your HTML, and Netlify handles the rest.
- **Serverless Functions**: Extend your site's functionality with Netlify Functions, allowing you to run server-side code in response to events.
- **Identity Management**: Add user authentication and manage user data with Netlify Identity.
- **Split Testing**: Run A/B tests to optimize your site's performance and user experience.
- **Documentation**: Link to the official [netlify documentation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).

Deploying a site on Netlify is straightforward. You can start by linking your repository, configuring build settings, and deploying your site in just a few clicks.

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is an excellent choice for hosting static sites directly from a GitHub repository. It’s particularly popular for open-source projects and personal websites. Key features include:

- **Free Hosting**: Host your static sites for free with GitHub Pages.
- **Custom Domains**: Use custom domains with your GitHub Pages site easily.
- **Jekyll Integration**: GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, a static site generator, allowing you to build and deploy Jekyll sites effortlessly.
- **Version Control**: Take advantage of Git’s version control features to manage your site’s content.
- **Documentation**: Link to the official [github pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

To deploy a site on GitHub Pages, you can create a repository named `<username>.github.io` and push your site's files to it. GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site.

## 2. Serverless Deployment

Serverless deployment allows you to run your application without managing the underlying server infrastructure. This approach is great for apps with unpredictable traffic and where you want to scale automatically. Serverless platforms automatically scale based on demand and charge you only for the resources you use.

### AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run code in response to events and scales automatically. It’s a popular choice for building microservices and event-driven applications. Key features include:

- **Event-Driven Execution**: Run code in response to HTTP requests, file uploads, database changes, etc. Lambda supports various event sources such as API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, and more.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Lambda scales your application seamlessly based on the number of incoming requests, ensuring you only pay for the compute time you use.
- **Integrated Services**: Easily integrate with other AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, and SNS.
- **Security**: Manage permissions with AWS IAM, ensuring your functions have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
- **Documentation**: Link to the official [AWS Lambda documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) and the [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/#:~:text=With%20AWS%20Lambda%2C%20you%20can,service%E2%80%94all%20with%20zero%20administration).

To deploy a Lambda function, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or infrastructure as code tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform. AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is another useful framework for building serverless applications.

### Azure Functions

Azure Functions offers similar capabilities to AWS Lambda with tight integration into the Azure ecosystem. Highlights include:

- **Flexible Triggering**: Execute functions in response to HTTP requests, timers, events from other Azure services, and more. Azure Functions supports various triggers and bindings, making it easy to connect to different services.
- **Integrated Monitoring**: Easily monitor and troubleshoot your functions with Azure Application Insights, providing detailed insights into your application's performance.

## 4. Containerization

Containerization packages your application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments. This method is ideal for microservices architectures and applications requiring high portability.

### Docker

Docker is a widely used containerization platform that allows you to build, share, and run containers. Its features include:

- **Isolation**: Run your applications in isolated containers, ensuring they don’t interfere with each other.
- **Portability**: Ensure your application runs consistently across different environments, from your local machine to the cloud.

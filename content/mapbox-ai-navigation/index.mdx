# Mapbox AI Navigation SDK


In the modern dev world! Where every other day, someone's slapping an "AI-powered" label on their coffee maker. It's like we're all competing in the "Who Can Shove AI Into the Most Unnecessary Places" Olympics. But hold onto your neural networks, folks, because Mapbox has actually done something that makes us sit up and say, "Hey, that AI thing? It actually makes sense here!".
Today, we're taking a deep dive into one of their most groundbreaking offerings: the Mapbox AI Navigation SDK. This powerful tool is not just improving navigation; it's completely transforming how developers approach routing and user experience in their applications.

> Before we delve into the AI Navigation SDK, if you're new to Mapbox or want a refresher on its core features, check out my previous blog post on [Mapbox Fundamentals](https://blog.amaanbhati.tech/blogs/mapbox-doing-wonders) or [visit the official Mapbox website](https://www.mapbox.com/). It provides a solid foundation for understanding Mapbox's capabilities. 

>In this article, we'll also explore how to integrate Mapbox into your project and take a look at a practical example. I've also built a Mapbox directions app using Next.js, which you can find on GitHub: [Mapbox Directions App](https://github.com/amaan-bhati/mapbox-directions-app). This will give you a hands-on perspective of working with Mapbox in a real-world scenario.

## What is Mapbox AI Navigation SDK?

If only [Robert Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost) had access to the Mapbox AI Navigation SDK! Picture this: our poetic wanderer standing at a yellow wood, not with two roads diverging, but with an AI-powered smartphone in hand. Instead of pondering which path to take, he'd simply ask MapGPT, "Which road shall I—traveler long standing—choose?" And lo, the AI would analyze real-time trail conditions, factor in Frost's penchant for the road less traveled, and even consider the optimal selfie spots for those "I took the one less traveled by" moments. No more sighing ages and ages hence; with Mapbox AI, Frost would confidently stride down the path that has made all the difference—at least according to the algorithm's 99.9% certainty. It's not just a navigation tool; it's the digital compass for the indecisive poet in all of us, turning those yellow woods into a precisely mapped adventure, one AI-optimized verse at a time.

## Implementing Mapbox AI Navigation SDK in a Next.js Application

Let's walk through the complete process of integrating the Mapbox AI Navigation SDK into a Next.js application from scratch:

1. **Set up your Next.js project**:
   First, create a new Next.js project:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest mapbox-ai-navigation-demo
   cd mapbox-ai-navigation-demo
   ```

   Choose the following options during setup:
   - TypeScript: Yes
   - ESLint: Yes
   - Tailwind CSS: No (for simplicity)
   - `src/` directory: No
   - App Router: Yes
   - Import alias: No

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install mapbox-gl @mapbox/mapbox-gl-directions
   ```

3. **Create environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token_here
   ```

   Replace `your_mapbox_access_token_here` with your actual Mapbox access token.

4. **Update `app/layout.tsx`**:
   Add the Mapbox GL CSS to the layout:

   ```tsx
   import './globals.css'
   import type { Metadata } from 'next'
   import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

   const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: 'Mapbox AI Navigation Demo',
     description: 'A demo of Mapbox AI Navigation in Next.js',
   }

   export default function RootLayout({
     children,
   }: {
     children: React.ReactNode
   }) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <head>
           <link href='https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.9.1/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet' />
         </head>
         <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
       </html>
     )
   }
   ```

5. **Create a Map component**:
   Create a new file `app/components/Map.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   'use client'

   import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'
   import mapboxgl from 'mapbox-gl'
   import MapboxDirections from '@mapbox/mapbox-gl-directions/dist/mapbox-gl-directions'

   mapboxgl.accessToken = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN!

   export default function Map() {
     const mapContainer = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
     const map = useRef<mapboxgl.Map | null>(null)
     const [lng, setLng] = useState(-74.5)
     const [lat, setLat] = useState(40)
     const [zoom, setZoom] = useState(9)

     useEffect(() => {
       if (map.current) return // initialize map only once
       map.current = new mapboxgl.Map({
         container: mapContainer.current!,
         style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11',
         center: [lng, lat],
         zoom: zoom
       })

       const directions = new MapboxDirections({
         accessToken: mapboxgl.accessToken,
         unit: 'metric',
         profile: 'mapbox/driving'
       })

       map.current.addControl(directions, 'top-left')

       map.current.on('move', () => {
         setLng(parseFloat(map.current!.getCenter().lng.toFixed(4)))
         setLat(parseFloat(map.current!.getCenter().lat.toFixed(4)))
         setZoom(parseFloat(map.current!.getZoom().toFixed(2)))
       })

       map.current.on('load', () => {
         console.log('Map loaded and ready for AI navigation features')
       })
     }, [])

     return (
       <div>
         <div className="sidebar">
           Longitude: {lng} | Latitude: {lat} | Zoom: {zoom}
         </div>
         <div ref={mapContainer} className="map-container" style={{ height: '100vh' }} />
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

6. **Update `app/page.tsx`**:
   Replace the content of `app/page.tsx` with:

   ```tsx
   import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

   const Map = dynamic(() => import('./components/Map'), {
     loading: () => <p>Loading map...</p>,
     ssr: false
   })

   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <main>
         <Map />
       </main>
     )
   }
   ```

7. **Implement AI features**:
   Add a new file `app/utils/mapboxAI.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export async function calculateSmartRange(origin: [number, number], destination: [number, number]) {
     const url = `https://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/driving/${origin[0]},${origin[1]};${destination[0]},${destination[1]}`;
     const params = new URLSearchParams({
       access_token: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN!,
       geometries: 'geojson',
       overview: 'full',
       steps: 'true',
       annotations: 'duration,distance,speed'
     });

     try {
       const response = await fetch(`${url}?${params}`);
       const data = await response.json();
       
       const route = data.routes[0];
       const distance = route.distance; // in meters
       const duration = route.duration; // in seconds
       
       console.log(`Total distance: ${distance / 1000} km`);
       console.log(`Estimated duration: ${duration / 60} minutes`);
       
       // Simple estimation, adjust as needed
       const estimatedRange = distance * 1.2;
       
       console.log(`Estimated range needed: ${estimatedRange / 1000} km`);
       
       return estimatedRange;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error calculating smart range:', error);
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

8. **Update Map component to use AI features**:
   Modify `app/components/Map.tsx` to include the smart range calculation:

   ```tsx
   // ... (previous imports)
   import { calculateSmartRange } from '../utils/mapboxAI'

   export default function Map() {
     // ... (previous code)

     useEffect(() => {
       // ... (previous code)

       map.current.on('load', () => {
         console.log('Map loaded and ready for AI navigation features')

         // @ts-ignore (TypeScript doesn't recognize the 'on' method for MapboxDirections)
         directions.on('route', (e: any) => {
           const origin = e.route[0].legs[0].steps[0].maneuver.location;
           const destination = e.route[0].legs[0].steps[e.route[0].legs[0].steps.length - 1].maneuver.location;
           
           calculateSmartRange(origin, destination)
             .then(range => console.log(`Smart range calculation complete. Estimated range: ${range / 1000} km`))
             .catch(error => console.error('Error in smart range calculation:', error));
         });
       })
     }, [])

     // ... (rest of the component)
   }
   ```

9. **Run your application**:
   Start your Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

This setup provides a basic implementation of the Mapbox AI Navigation SDK with a smart range feature in a Next.js application. The map will be displayed on the page, and you can use the directions control to plot routes. When a route is calculated, the smart range estimation will be logged to the console.

Remember that full AI capabilities might require additional API calls and more complex logic depending on your specific use case. Always refer to the latest Mapbox documentation for the most up-to-date implementation details and available features.

## Real-World Integration: Testing a Next.js CRUD Application

### Setting Up the Next.js Project

To demonstrate Keploy‚Äôs capabilities, we‚Äôll use a Next.js application as an example. This project will implement a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

#### Step 1: Initialize a Next.js Application

Run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest keploy-crud-app
```

Follow the prompts to set up your application. Once complete, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd keploy-crud-app
```

#### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for building a CRUD application:

```bash
npm install axios mongoose
```

#### Step 3: Set Up a Backend API

Create a `pages/api` folder and add CRUD endpoints. For example, to handle a `users` resource:

```javascript
// pages/api/users.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
});

const User = mongoose.models.User || mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);

  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    const users = await User.find();
    res.status(200).json(users);
  } else if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const user = new User(req.body);
    await user.save();
    res.status(201).json(user);
  } else {
    res.status(405).end();
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>
```

#### Step 5: Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start your application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your CRUD API is now live at `http://localhost:3000/api/users`.

---

### Integrating Keploy with the Next.js Application

#### Step 1: Record API Calls

Run your Next.js application with Keploy to start capturing API interactions. Use the following command:

```bash
keploy record -c "npm run dev"
```

#### Step 2: Replay Test Cases

Once the API calls are recorded, you can replay them to test for regressions. Use this command:

```bash
keploy test -c "npm run dev" --delay 10
```

#### Step 3: Analyze Results

Keploy will provide detailed test case results, highlighting any regressions introduced by code changes.

---

### How Keploy Saves Time and Effort

#### Without Keploy:
- Manual test case writing is required for each API endpoint.
- Developers must handle mock data and test configurations manually.
- Testing for regressions involves repetitive effort.

#### With Keploy:
- Automatically generates test cases from real API interactions.
- Simplifies mock and stub management.
- Enables quick and efficient regression testing.

This automation reduces development overhead and ensures reliable API performance.

## Keploy Unit Test Generator

Keploy's unit test generator (UTG) implementation of the Meta LLM research paper is the first to understand code semantics and generate meaningful unit tests. It aims to:

- **Automate unit test generation (UTG):** Quickly generate comprehensive unit tests and reduce redundant manual effort.
- **Improve edge cases:** Extend and improve the scope of tests to cover more complex scenarios that are often missed manually.
- **Boost test coverage:** As the codebase grows, ensuring exhaustive coverage becomes feasible.

### Usage

```bash
keploy gen [flag]
```

### Prerequisites

An API key for the AI model is needed, which can be obtained from:

- OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview" target="_blank">GPT-4</a> (preferred)
- Alternative LLMs via <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview" target="_blank">litellm</a>
- <a href = "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/ai-services/openai-service" target= "_blank"> Azure OpenAI</a> Services

Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export API_KEY=xxxx
```

### Running with JavaScript/TypeScript Applications

To ensure the coverage report is in Cobertura format, modify your `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "coverageReporters": ["text", "cobertura"]
}
```

Or, if `jest.config.js` is present:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  coverageReporters: ["text", "cobertura"],
};
```

#### Generating Unit Tests

You can test a smaller section of the application or control costs by generating tests for a single source and its corresponding test file:

```bash
keploy gen --source-file-path="<path to source file>" \
    --test-file-path="<path to test file for above source file>" \
    --test-command="npm test" \
    --coverage-report-path="<path to coverage.xml>"
```

For the entire application, use `--test-dir` instead of `--test-file-path`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Running the command with `--test-dir` will generate unit tests for all files in the application. Depending on the size of the codebase, this process may take between 20 minutes to an hour and will incur costs related to LLM usage.

#### Example

Consider an <a href="https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript/tree/main/express-mongoose" target="_blank">Express-Mongoose</a> sample application with Jest test cases under the `test` folder named `routes.test.js`. Modify the `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "collectCoverage": true,
  "coverageReporters": ["text", "cobertura"],
  "coverageDirectory": "./coverage"
}
```

Run the Keploy UTG command:

```bash
keploy gen \
  --source-file-path="./src/routes/routes.js" \
  --test-file-path="./test/routes.test.js" \
  --test-command="npm test" \
  --coverage-report-path="./coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml"
```

We will get the following output:
<Image 
    src="/blogs/keploy-testcase-generation-1.png"
    alt="Keploy test case generation"
    width={800}
    height={400}
/>

```plaintext
Keploy test coverage with AI-generated unit tests for Express-Mongoose
Voila!! The generated test cases provide 58% coverageüåü
```

### Running with Golang Applications

To ensure Cobertura-formatted coverage reports, install:

```bash
go install github.com/axw/gocov/gocov@v1.1.0
go install github.com/AlekSi/gocov-xml@v1.1.0
```

#### Generating Unit Tests

Run the following command:

```bash
keploy gen --source-file-path="<path to source file>" \
  --test-file-path="<path to test file for above source file>" \
  --test-command="go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" \
  --coverage-report-path="<path to coverage.xml>"
```

For the entire application, use `--test-dir` instead of `--test-file-path`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Running the command with `--test-dir` will generate unit tests for all files in the application. Depending on the size of the codebase, this process may take between 20 minutes to an hour and will incur costs related to LLM usage.

#### Example

Consider a Mux-SQL sample application with a test file `app_test.go` for the source file `app.go`:

```bash
keploy gen --source-file-path="app.go" \
  --test-file-path="app_test.go" \
  --test-command="go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" \
  --coverage-report-path="./coverage.xml"
```
